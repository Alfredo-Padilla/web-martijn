        <p>The Work of Martijn van Boven</p>

        <p>
            Martijn van Boven (1977) is a visual artist from Amsterdam, with a focus on experimental films and computer generated art. His work is expressed through installations, films, collaborations with composers, and cinema performances.
            Van Boven has been the head of Design Art Technology at the ArteZ Institute from 2012 until 2021 and was a teacher in the field of Media Archeology, Audio-Visual Design and Avant-Garde Film History.Van Boven received his credentials at the Image and Sound department of the Royal Art Academy in The Hague. He has been focused on abstract filmmaking since 2000, co-founded the Hague’s TAG Media Center in 2003, and in 2005 joined the curatorial team of Sonic Acts, the Netherlands-based festival operating at the intersection of art, music and science. He currently lives and works in Amsterdam.

            A short note about some of his work
            His work “Walzkörpersperre,” on 35mm celluloid for projection on a monumental vertical screen, was created by scanning the architectural elements of a bunker wall.
            “Field Notes From a Mine” is a computer-generated film with no filmed materials and is composed of vast collections of data, mined from the statistics of the historical pilgrimage route which crossed from East to West Africa.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of his most known works, “Black Smoking Mirror,” is a performance in collaboration with sound artist Gert-Jan Prins including the building of a fixed screen of inflammable canvas, with the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which after combustion caused by a laser, carries the remains of the light engraving.
            In 2017 he produced the first computational coin A Circulation Of Circuits a network of compact computers prepared of digital exchange of cultural goods. Which carries the early development of NFT distribution systems of digital art. Van Boven’s work is heavily influenced by filmmakers such as Stan Brakhage, John and James Whitney, Larry Cuba and artists from the field of computational art and design.
